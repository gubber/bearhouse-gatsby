    There's never a bad time for cake and there's a cake for every occasion.

    For a special birthday why not surprise someone with a bespoke multi-layered decadent vanilla sponge, with Swiss meringue buttercream, decorated to your specification.

    Having the girls round for a cuppa? Perhaps some rich, indulgant chocolate brownies or a selection of delicate macarons?

    If you would like to send a 'thank you' to someone special, a cupcake bouquet is always a winner.

    Perhaps a large cake is too much for a small gathering? Why not try some individual cake slices presented on a decorated board.
