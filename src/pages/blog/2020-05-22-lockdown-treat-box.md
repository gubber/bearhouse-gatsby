It has been lovely to do some baking for people other than my family for a change so I am looking forward to delivering these boxes to friends that I am really missing during lockdown.


## Lockdown is better with cake

- Salted caramel & Biscoff cupcakes
- Vanilla cupcakes
- Chocolate brownies
- Macarons
- Apricot and sunflower seed oat cookies
